# Dropout Newsletter RSS Transformer

A tool for transforming the **Kill The Newsletter** RSS feed into per-show RSS feeds for Dropout content.

## Overview

This project takes the Kill The Newsletter RSS feed (which aggregates Dropout newsletter content) and transforms it into individual, organized RSS feeds for each show on the Dropout platform. This allows you to subscribe to specific shows without having to parse through a general newsletter feed.

## Purpose

**Kill The Newsletter** converts email newsletters into RSS feeds. However, the Dropout newsletter is a single combined feed containing content from multiple shows. This transformer solves that problem by:

- Parsing the Kill The Newsletter RSS feed
- Identifying individual shows and episodes
- Creating separate RSS feeds for each show
- Maintaining chronological order and metadata
- Allowing selective subscription to shows of interest

## Features

- 📺 **Per-Show RSS Feeds**: Generate individual feeds for each Dropout show
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates**: Continuously sync with the Kill The Newsletter feed (every 6 hours via GitHub Actions)
- 📋 **Complete Metadata**: Preserve episode information, descriptions, and dates
- 📅 **Air Day Information**: Episodes include the day of the week they air (e.g., "Friday 1:30pm ET")
- 🌍 **Timezone Conversion**: Optionally convert air times from ET to your local timezone
- 🎯 **Selective Subscription**: Subscribe only to shows you want to follow
- 🚀 **Simple Setup**: Easy to configure and deploy with GitHub Actions
- 🔒 **Privacy**: Source feed URL stored securely as a GitHub secret (not publicly visible)

## How It Works

### Step 1: Get Your Kill The Newsletter URL

1. Visit [Kill The Newsletter](https://www.killTheNewsletter.com/)
2. Enter the Dropout newsletter email address
3. Receive your Kill The Newsletter RSS feed URL

### Step 2: Configure the Transformer

The transformer reads the Kill The Newsletter RSS feed and parses each episode to identify:
- Episode title and show name
- Publication date
- Episode description/summary
- Content details

### Step 3: Generate Per-Show Feeds

The tool creates individual RSS feeds organized by show:
- `feeds/show-name.xml` - Individual show feeds
- `feeds/all-shows.xml` - Combined feed (optional)

### Step 4: Subscribe

Use your preferred RSS reader to subscribe to:
- Individual show feeds: `https://your-domain/feeds/show-name.xml`
- All shows feed: `https://your-domain/feeds/all-shows.xml`

## Quick Start with GitHub Actions (Recommended)

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. **Add your feed URL as a secret**:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Create a new secret named `KILL_THE_NEWSLETTER_URL`
   - Paste your Kill The Newsletter feed URL as the value
4. **Trigger the workflow**:
   - Go to Actions → Update RSS Feeds → Run workflow

📖 **Detailed setup instructions**: See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Local Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dakomi/dropout-newsletter-rss.git
cd dropout-newsletter-rss

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Kill The Newsletter RSS feed URL
KILL_THE_NEWSLETTER_URL=https://www.killTheNewsletter.com/feeds/xxxxx.xml

# Output directory for generated feeds
OUTPUT_DIR=./feeds

# Update frequency (in minutes)
UPDATE_INTERVAL=60

# Timezone offset from ET in hours (optional, default: 0)
# Examples (assuming US is observing DST):
#   0 = Eastern Time (ET) - no conversion
#   3 = Brazil (BRT) is ET+3
#   5 = UK (BST) is ET+5
#   15 = Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST) is ET+15
# Note: This is a simple hour offset and doesn't automatically adjust for DST.
# You may need to update when DST transitions occur.
TIMEZONE_OFFSET=0
```

### Timezone Configuration

The `TIMEZONE_OFFSET` setting allows you to convert episode air times from Eastern Time (ET) to your local timezone. This is particularly useful for international viewers who want to see when episodes air in their local time.

**Features:**
- Automatically adjusts air times to your timezone
- Adjusts the day of the week when crossing midnight
- Includes the day of the week in episode descriptions (e.g., "Friday 1:30pm ET")

**Examples:**

For Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT, UTC+11, during Australian summer):
- When US is on DST (summer): Use `TIMEZONE_OFFSET=16`
- When US is on Standard Time (winter): Use `TIMEZONE_OFFSET=15`

For UK (BST, UTC+1, during UK summer):
- When US is on DST: Use `TIMEZONE_OFFSET=5`
- When US is on Standard Time: Use `TIMEZONE_OFFSET=4`

**Note:** This is a simple hour-based offset and doesn't automatically adjust for daylight saving time changes. You may need to update the offset when DST transitions occur.

## Usage

### Run the Transformer

```bash
# Single run
python transform.py

# Specify timezone offset for conversion (e.g., +15 for AEST)
python transform.py --timezone-offset 15

# Continuous mode (updates at specified interval)
python transform.py --watch
```

### Command Line Options

- `--url URL`: Kill The Newsletter feed URL (overrides `KILL_THE_NEWSLETTER_URL` env var)
- `--output DIR`: Output directory for feeds (overrides `OUTPUT_DIR` env var)
- `--base-url URL`: Base URL for feed self-references
- `--timezone-offset HOURS`: Timezone offset from ET in hours (overrides `TIMEZONE_OFFSET` env var)
- `--watch`: Continuous mode (not yet implemented)

### Output

The generated feeds will be saved in the configured `OUTPUT_DIR`:

```
feeds/
├── all-shows.xml              # Combined feed for all shows
├── breaking-news.xml
├── dimension-20.xml
├── game-changer.xml
├── rats-rent-a-shop.xml
├── um-actually.xml
└── ... (one file per show)
```

Each feed is a valid RSS 2.0 feed that can be imported into any RSS reader.
